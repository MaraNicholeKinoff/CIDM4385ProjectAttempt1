# CIDM 4385 Final Project Attempt 1

ISCAP is a professional association of Information Systems Educators and holds a conference every year.  For this conference, it would be helpful if they had a mobile app such that they might better coordinate during the conference.

The conference organizers need a simple app to implement the following features:

    Push Notifications
    Speaker/Presenter Bios
    A list of sessions (a schedule of events)
    Upload photos
    Maps of the location
    Events and the ability to search/filter events
    Social Media
    FAQs
